The flow is:
Yessss
When an object enters a snapzone, subscribe the snapzone to the drop event of the object


When an object is dropped, broadcast that event by invoking the event
The snapzone's delegate will then try to snap the object (if the snapzone is empty)

When an object leaves a snapzone, unsubscribe the snapzone from the drop event of the object

When an object is dropped, (subscribe the snapzone to the drop event)

if it's in a snapzone, 

and the snapzone is empty,

snap the object to the snapzone
